    - `git clone https://username:password@github.com/Sootds/sootds-server.git`
    - `username` is your GitHub username
    - `password` is your personal access token generated from step 1

    - `git config user.name`
    - `git config user.email`

### Running the client locally

1. Install the required libraries, packages and dependencies by typing this command in your terminal:

    - `npm i`

2. Install the required developer dependencies by typing this command in your terminal:

    - `npm i -D` or `npm i --save-dev`

3. Run the client locally by typing this command in your terminal:

    - `npm run start`

4. After running that command, an output will provide a URL link that you can copy and paste in to your browser. The link should look something like:
